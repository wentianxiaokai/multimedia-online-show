The idea to this plugin based on a similar WordPress plugin "SEO Friendly Images" by Vladimir Prelovac. This plugin version has more settings, possibilities to configure your »alt« / »title« attributes and it’s actively maintained. There is also a sync function, that automatically use existing »alt« as »title« and vice versa if one of the values exist.
